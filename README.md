# CPE 1040 - Introduction to Computer Engineering
## Assignment: Final Project
### Microbit LEDs
#### Part 1: Original Guide
For this part of the project I simply followed the instructions given in the [guide.](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/microbit-breakout-board-hookup-guide#hardware-overview) Its operations can be seen in this [video.](https://imgur.com/a/USeeEM2)
#### Part 2: Enable Matrix
For this part of the project I looked at the microbit pins [documentation](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/microbit-breakout-board-hookup-guide#hardware-overview) and saw that pins 8, 12 and 16 did not affect the 5x5 matrix. In order to enable the matrix I had to rewire the breadboard and edit the code so that it would use those pins for the led control. Its new operations can be seen in this [video.](https://imgur.com/a/bm1HBoh)
#### Part 3: Twenty Eight
For this part of the project I choose to implement the leds in my snake screensaver. I changed it so that depending on the rows that the head of the snake was currently in, only one of the LEDs would be enabled. Its operations can be seen in this [video.](https://imgur.com/a/Z7SXWyn)
### Soil Sensor
#### Part 1: Digital in
